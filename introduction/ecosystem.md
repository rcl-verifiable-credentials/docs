# Eco-System
**V1.0**

These guidance documents are targeted at holders and issuers who use the RCL Verifiable Credentials Web/Mobile Wallet and the  Issuer App to manage digital credentials.

# What are Verifiable Credentials

Verifiable Credentials are issued to holders to recognize their achievements. They are machine-readable and are secured by cryptographic methods to maintain confidentiality and integrity. They are shareable utilizing the technology available and portable as they can be interchanged among computer systems without any modifications.
