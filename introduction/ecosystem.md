## Holder

A holder is a person that receives a digital credential for their achievement from the issuer.

## Verifier

A holder will share their digital credentials with verifiers to check their validity and make a determination on the holder's achievement, eg. for employment. Verifiers can include employers.

## Application Hosters

An application hoster is an individual, organization or government agency that hosts the Credentials Web Wallet or Credentials Issuer applications either internally for their employees or externally for the general public.

# Specifications

## W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs)

The [W3C Specification for Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-overview) outlines the technical specification that the digital credentials must comply with. It is an internationally recognized specification that ensures the digital credentials are secure, easily shared, authentic and verifiable.

## Open Badges 3.0 (OBs)

The [Open Badges 3.0](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0) specification is aligned to the W3C Specification for Verifiable Credentials and provides a data model and interchangeability mechanisms for digital credentials among computer systems.

## W3C Decentralized Identifier (DID)

The [W3C Decentralized Identifier](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.1/) is a specification to identify entities such as the holders and issuers of digital credentials. It provides the entities with a unique identification for greater security and validity.
