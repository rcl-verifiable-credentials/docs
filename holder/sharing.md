# Sharing Credentials
**V1.0**

A holder can share verifiable credentials with verifiers such as employers and peers. You will be sharing all your [Collections](/holder/credentials.md#collections). To share your collections :

- In the portal, click on ``Sharing`` in the side menu

- In the ``Sharing List``, add a user to share the collection. The user must use the ``Verifier`` portal to view the collection

- To preview your sharing page, to see what the verifier will see, click on the ``Preview Shared Page`` in the ``Manage`` drop down menu for a selected user in the ``Sharing List``
